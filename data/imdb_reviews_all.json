I&#39;m so happy it was included in the end of the last attack. Especially seeing Ymir walking along the sidewalk with Maria, Rose, and Sina as the trio left the theatre. Seeing them all at peace was so healing. That being said, I didn&#39;t get to watch it in theatres as it has not been released in my country, and saw it online.

In terms of story, the movie does well at condensing complex arcs and addressing major plot points, even if some elements feel slightly rushed. Longtime fans might find certain character decisions divisive or feel that the movie doesn&#39;t delve deeply enough into the philosophical questions raised by the series. However, for the sake of pacing and making it accessible to a broader audience, these choices mostly pay off. The ending for anime was already pretty good this was not needed.

    "text": "Attack On Titan doesn&#39;t deserve our money anymore. Visually, MAPPA&#39;s work is decent but lacks the polish of Wit Studio&#39;s earlier seasons. The titans models are underwhelming and inconsistent, pulling the attention out of critical moments. The characters and objects blend in the scenario and the scenes lack any constrast. The motivations and dialogues are all messy, Armin is more concerned about Eren hurting Mikasa&#39;s feelings than him destroying the whole world. Eren fails to explain why he did the rumbling, and blames it on him being an idiot. Hange dies for no reason. And Zeke&#39;s death doesn&#39;t feel deserving. The alliance is formed just by a mere convenience. And the bird scene in the ending no one knows what it&#39;s supposed to mean. Attack On Titan&#39;s ending is one of the most disapointing ones by far and also one of the biggest animation downgrades in anime industry. The animation doesn&#39;t survive a second watch and it&#39;s already dated. Both things completely harmed the Attack On Titan brand as a whole, even if most people refuse to admit. No matter of much they try, and how many redraws they make, Mappa can&#39;t seem to get even the colors right for this last movie. And that is very disappointing.",

The attack on titan ending acknowledges the devastating costs of war and the morally gray areas, presenting realistic consequences. The finale also cleverly ties together earlier hints and symbols, showcasing Isayama&#39;s meticulous planning. Moreover, the conclusion remains cohesive with the author&#39;s vision for the story. This is a great ending to me I don&#39;t care about anything else. I&#39;ve seen the other criticism and quite honestly they don&#39;t align with the story, to me it looks like they were too obsessed with their own theories that it ended up blinding them from the actual story.

Maybe, though, &quot;Armin&quot; and &quot;Mikasa&quot; can find a way to thwart him by combining their skills and forcing mankind to reconcile their different factions and join forces too? It&#39;s a conclusion to a series but stands alone well enough for you not to have followed that as this vivid, if not exactly detailed, animation takes us on a story of treachery, loyalty, and even a degree of light psychological horror as the android-looking critters threaten to obliterate humanity, like lemmings, over the edge of a cliff. In many ways it also serves as a tidying up exercise removing some established characters, sometimes quite emotionally, as the denouement embodies the values of teamwork and resilience whilst impressing us with some acrobatics and quirks along the way. It would certainly help if you&#39;d seen the rest of the series, but the studios are getting much better at packaging these cinema releases to make sense on their own without detailed previous knowledge of the characters, and this action drama does just about enough even if it is very long for what it is, and there is a great deal of padding.",

There&#39;s more I could talk about that I loved about the ending, like the Visual Presentation and Symbolism of Eren and Armin&#39;s conversation, the fractured mind of Eren Jeager and how his powers contributed to his cage and psychological horror, the little moments like Levi&#39;s and hanges&#39;s conclusions, or Reiner being emotional over being called a scout yet again instead of a traitor he was once called, or Armin alleviating the burden of Eren&#39;s action since he also feels responsible for not only Eren&#39;s sacrifice, but also for fact that he was an instigator of Eren&#39;s goals, and many more things that will make this &quot;essay&quot; even longer.

Narrative, storytelling, development and twists, it&#39;s quite easy to take for granted how near flawlessly it&#39;s all crafted. Sadly, none of this is something you can make certain people truly understand through words or argumentation at all, so it&#39;s up to them to remain on biased, groundless, even utterly immature hate, or move on. Placed among the highest rated shows or not, Attack on Titan&#39;s greatness is incontestable, and remains a masterwork.",

The anime, it&#39;s foreshadowing, Bgm, story, Plot twist, animation,characters development, sacrifice literally everything is perfect 10/10.<br/><br/>Atleast respect the art &amp; artist and stop down rating. Infact as a anime fan we should feel proud that aot episode are in the highest rated IMdb episode 🔥😔.<br/><br/>Ending was good too, even without the Titans&#39; existence,humanity will fall into evil, war, and hate, just like Eren said. The cycle will continue to repeat itself &amp; nothing can actually change that.<br/><br/>Give this anime the respect it deserves 🙏🙂",

The extra scene they added was so cool. Goth Mikasa is one the best things ever and the restaurant and Ymir part was probably my favorite part of that extra part. Overall this is one of if not the best movie I have ever seen. I hate that One Piece glazers are review bombing this because it does in fact deserve a 10/10. The final salute by Levi is one of my favorite parts of the entire anime. I cried so much at Hanges death she was truly the best female character in the anime. EREN DID NOTHING WRONG AND HE WAS RIGHT.",

It condensed an intricate, beloved story into a shallow overview, losing much of the emotional depth and character development that had drawn fans to the series in the first place. It was marketed as a way to introduce new viewers to the world, but it came off as a cheap, rushed product with little of the charm or complexity that made the original work special.<br/><br/>In the end, both the season and the movie felt like cash grabs, aimed at milking a loyal fanbase without delivering anything meaningful. Fans were left disappointed, feeling that the magic of the original series had been tarnished by these lackluster.",

The opening was amazing but I did miss the rumbling intro though. And whenever you know that Eren knew everything and the way they portrayed him at the end was amazing I truly am speechless. I loved how mappa didn&#39;t change to much in the way they did the anime in terms of even more modern technology of animation they just went with what AOT already is in terms of anime artwork. Anyway as a AOT fan I highly recommend to watch this, I hope you get to enjoy it as much as I did!",

When I heard it was coming out in cinemas I was just super thrilled (especially hearing there was unseen scenes post credits). Now when I experience &quot;The Rumbling&quot; in cinemas, it felt the same way it felt watching it a year ago, if not even better. Unfortunately the unseen scenes did leave me with some overwhelming theories, but the ending is ambiguous which I&#39;m biased against. Nonetheless, I guarantee you&#39;ll love this if you loved watching the anime. Some things I would have liked (personally) is more answers to what happens post rumbling, like who did Mikasa get with, who&#39;s the kid that&#39;s about to enter the same tree? Is the kid going to find the source of all living matter reborn? Was the whole story just a movie to what we saw post credits? I&#39;m most likely thinking too far in to it, but it makes for some interesting theories. I usually like non ambiguous endings but for something like this, I give an exception due to the pure emotion, voice acting, art work and story telling it conveyed. Would definitely watch it in theatres again!",

    "text": "So I&#39;ve just come from the 4DX theater after watching ATTACK ON TITAN THE LAST ATTACK. This was a once in a lifetime experience for me, I actually got to feel what it&#39;s like to fly with the ODM Gear the characters use and let me tell you. You haven&#39;t lived til you felt that feeling of high winds across your faces while your moving through the air so fast. The best was the brand new post credit scene they added to the ending to give it a more peaceful ending for characters living in such a dark story.<br/><br/>As long as I live I&#39;ll never forget tonight, it was a night I&#39;ve been waiting and dreading for almost 12 years.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve been with this series ever since I was just a scrawny kid in middle school when my cousin showed me the computer game and then the next year after that, my best friend showed me one of the Greatest Tv Shows to ever exist for the first time.<br/><br/>At first, It scared the crap out of me, the idea of giants that look like people who eat us alive, it was like my worst nightmare straight out of the walking dead, but bigger. It was a good long while before I got over that and really built up the courage to pay attention to the story and characters who lived it.<br/><br/>This was one of the first few anime I had ever watched at that point knowing what the word &quot;Anime&quot; truly meant, an undeniable beautiful art form for expression that transcends where it goes to be seen and comes from.<br/><br/>I have evolved more as a person over these last 10 years because of this show alongside side these amazing and inspiring characters. I&#39;ve watched many of them suffer and die horrible deaths for their beliefs and struggles for a world where they can live in peace and freedom for all mankind.<br/><br/>But, both Attack On Titan and the reality of life is that the world can be a truly cruel and unforgivable place, with hell on Earth for those caught in it, but what makes it worth being in is the people you share your life and pain with.<br/><br/>The lives that you&#39;ve impacted and have been impacted by thanks to the actions of others. As long as you have those people who you are truly close with and trust with your life,\nyou can bring down any giant that comes your way.<br/><br/>Without Attack On Titan, without this once in a century human story, its many diverse characters and themes of the experience of human life<br/><br/>.......<br/><br/>Without Eren Jaeger, I wouldn&#39;t be the person am I today that most know me as. Thanks to all of them, I tried my best to socialize more in school and meet newer people I could call my friends.<br/><br/>As I got older I was amazed how Eren, in his own way, mastered both his uncontrolled rage and his Incredible strength, which at times threatened his comrades and turned it against the insurmountable odds that would destroy his home. He became a better person for it by learning to point them towards positive outcomes. Then in high school, I took those qualities I saw in him that were inspiring to me and I found them hidden deep within in myself, By turning it into a positive but fierce determination that inspired me to explore outside my shell for the first time in my life.<br/><br/>To try something different from what I was used to. So I joined a more competitive sport than any other on campus, Wrestling. It was there I was able to grow more as a social individual who isn&#39;t held back by any pre existing conditions that limits my communication and to physically better myself while having fun working with others.<br/><br/>This show, this story, These Remarkable yet also ordinary people who went through hell allowed me to be a more driven and determined person who never wants to be held back by anything ever again. Someone who smashes through life&#39;s obstacles as they come at you no matter how hard or how giant they are.<br/><br/>You could be like some people and tell me that it&#39;s just a show. That these people aren&#39;t even real to begin with.<br/><br/>But they are, to me and Millions of people across the Entire world.<br/><br/>Attack on Titan taught me how to persevere through all the bad and to enjoy all of the good my life has to offer me and for that I personally thank the Author: Hajime Isayama the teams behind the incredible animation, and all the voice actors who gave these characters a voice to be heard throughout the world\nUntil next time Eren Jaeger,\nI&#39;ll see you around\nShinzo Sasageyo- &quot;Dedicate your hearts&quot;",

The literal abyss I felt after completing the series is absolutely a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It was bittersweet.<br/><br/>That said, I had mostly healed from the wounds of the past. Until tonight, when I watched this &#39;re-release&#39; in American theaters. Dare I say it is better the 2nd time around, as I was not as impacted by the shock of what was happening as much and could really pay attention to the little details that make it a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Attack on Titan is the only example in the world of a &quot;perfect show.&quot; Character development, plot twists, subtle romance, thrill, action, and more all well-rounded into one epic blessing.<br/><br/>I appreciate the extra clips at the end that were included in the Movie and not the actual ending of the show. It was the perfect thing to add, with a little light-heartedness that makes you giggle but makes you think &quot;wow, maybe everything will be okay someday&quot; as life always has a strange way of playing out.<br/><br/>Anyway, I will recommend this show to as many people as I possibly can for as long as I live. If you are reading this in hesitancy to start the show, let this be your sign to watch it. Be prepared. (you can&#39;t prepare for something like this, but its fun to try ;))",

    "text": "The ending of Attack on Titan left me truly disappointed, almost like a betrayal of what the series once stood for. It felt as if it borrowed elements from other stories, like Code Geass, but failed to deliver the same impact. Ymir&#39;s story arc was one of the biggest letdowns - her supposed love for the king lacked credibility and didn&#39;t align with the depth of her suffering. Annie&#39;s ending felt undeserved given her character&#39;s actions, while Erwin deserved to be saved instead of Armin, who made decisions that led to an unsatisfying conclusion. Mikasa moving on with another man felt out of place after everything she shared with Eren, and Eren himself seemed more like a victim than a hero in the end. The worst part of it all was the ongoing war, which nullified everyone&#39;s sacrifices, making their efforts feel pointless. This was a series I once loved, but this finale tarnished it, leaving me with a sense of emptiness and frustration.",

We cried, we cheered, we laughed, and now it&#39;s time to say goodbye to one of the greatest pieces of fiction ever made.<br/><br/>Overall, the ending wraps things up beautifully.<br/><br/>I will not spoil anything, but I will say that there is a lot of subtlety and nuance to how things are concluded, not to mention some things are left ambiguous. There are so many things going on that it may be hard to keep up with all the different philosophies and motivations of the characters. Ultimately the meaning of the story and every character arc connect, but it may be hard to separate character opinions from the main message that I think Isayama wants to send. I think that it is obvious that Armin reflects the message best as he narrates the whole story and ultimately is the most reasonable character, who rebukes and counsels certain characters before the end. The second narrator (will not spoil who it is) helps conclude the ending message in a letter. By the end of the credits, we get some more to think about.<br/><br/>Speaking of end credits, there is a great little bonus at the very end, which reflects fan reactions. It ends with a coded message from the creator to the fans and it is wonderful!<br/><br/>Thank you, Isayama who wrote this amazing story and thank you WIT and MAPPA and everyone who helped bring this masterpiece to life!",
